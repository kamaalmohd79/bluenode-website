                </ul>
                <h3>4. How Long We Keep Your Information</h3>
                <p>At BlueNode, we only retain your personal information for as long as is necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected, as well as to satisfy any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements. <br /> <br />
                    Here's how we handle your information:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Account Information: </b>Personal information associated with your account, such as your email address and wallet address, is retained for as long as your account remains active. If you choose to deactivate your account, your personal information will be anonymized or securely destroyed unless further retention is required by law.</li>
                    <li><b>Bandwidth Usage Data: </b>Information about the bandwidth you contribute is retained to calculate rewards and ensure accurate distribution of $BLU tokens. This data is kept for the duration of your active participation in the network plus an additional period to comply with legal obligations (e.g., tax, audit, and accounting requirements).</li>
                    <li><b>Transaction Data: </b>Since transactions are recorded on the Solana blockchain, they remain there indefinitely as part of the public ledger. However, we ensure that any personal information tied to these transactions is handled in accordance with our privacy standards and blockchain's inherent security measures.</li>
                    <li><b>Legal Requirements: </b>In certain circumstances, we may be required to retain your information for a longer period, in compliance with specific legal requirements. For instance, we may keep data longer in the event of a legal or regulatory investigation.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>This retention policy ensures that your information is not kept longer than necessary and is securely disposed of when no longer needed.</p>
                <h3>5. Security Measures</h3>
                <p>We take the security of your bandwidth seriously. We implement various security measures, including encryption and physical security measures, to protect the exchanged traffic from unauthorized access and disclosure.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Full Encryption of Traffic (FET): </b>All bandwidth transmitted through our network is fully encrypted, minimizing the risk of data breaches or cyber-attacks.</li>
                    <li><b>Advanced Encryption Standard (AES): </b>AES encryption is used to protect IP addresses and the communication between users and our network.</li>
                    <li><b>Network Security Practices: </b>Including network segmentation using SDN techniques, deployment of firewalls, and real-time monitoring with Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDPS).</li>
                </ul>
                <p>These measures are designed to protect our infrastructure and ensure the security of the traffic and bandwidth shared by our users.</p>
                <h3>6. Marketing and Advertising Practices</h3>
